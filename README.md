CS 148: Audio Visualization Project

Overview
--------
To be added when we start actually putting the project together.

Examples
--------
I'm going through tutorials, and I'm adding examples which I think may be helpful in getting us up and running with respect to various aspects of the project. I'll try and keep an updated list here. 

For simple examples, you can just open the html file in your browser (Chrome may be best) and it should work. For more complicated examples (like those which read in an audio file, for instance), you will need to start a local server. The simplest way is to navigate to the main directory for this project and type "python -m SimpleHTTPServer", which should serve the page at "http://0.0.0.0/8000".

1. SimpleSphere: Demonstrates a single object with lighting and a camera.
2. Shader1: Demonstrates a simple custom shader (which should just color everything purple).
3. Shader2: Demonstrates a dynamic shader (and how to pass attributes, uniforms to the shaders - so easy compared to OpenGL!).
